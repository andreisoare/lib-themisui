# Modal â€” `thModal` / `thModalAnchor`

## Description

Creating a simple modal for your content is easy!

1. `<th-modal-anchor></th-modal-anchor>` is required in the body of your application

2. You must inject the `ModalManager` service into your controller in order to push your modal into the queue of modals

3. Use `ModalManager.show({path: path, params: params, name: name})` to add your modal and show it.
Both `name` & `params` are optional. `path` is **not** optional.

---

### Notes

`show()` will return a promise [?](http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html "Learn about promises")

Use `modal.dismiss(reason)` in your template to dismiss the modal with a `defer.reject(reason)`

Use `modal.confirm(response)` in your template to dismiss the modal with a `defer.resolve(response)`

Passing a `name` option will add that name as a class to the modal. Style according to what you need.
