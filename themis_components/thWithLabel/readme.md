# Input â€” `with-label`

## Description

Wrap your input fields in a styled label easily by adding this `with-label` component to it.

`<th-input with-label="My Label Name" ng-model="myModel"></th-input>`

- It can only be used an attribute to an existing input element.
- By default the label prepended to the input field which means that it will show up above the element.
- Labels for input types `checkbox` and `radio` are set inline.
- It can be used with any HTML element if one were so inclined but it is really recommended for use with input elements.
