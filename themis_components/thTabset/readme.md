# Tabs â€” `thTabset` / `thTab`

## Description

Want some tabs? The `th-tabset` & `th-tab` power duo are just what you were looking for.

Each `th-tab` gets a `name` which will be used as the label for the tab bar. Any content inside of `th-tab` will be the content of that tab.

Combine this with `th-lazy` for an extreme team of lazy-loaded tabs!

## Usage

```
<th-tabset>
  <th-tab name="Tab One">
    Tab One Content
  </th-tab>
  <th-tab name="Tab Two">
    Tab Two Content
  </th-tab>
</th-tabset>
```
