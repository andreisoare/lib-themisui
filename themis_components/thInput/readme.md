# Input â€” `thInput`

## Description

Add your input fields with a little style.

* Unlike `<input>`, `<th-input>` must be explictly closed. This is a browser enforced limitation of custom elements.

* Plenty of options can be passed into your input including..labels, Icons, Postfix, Prefix
* `<input>` attributes can be passed in like you normally would (name | placeholder | value | type | id)
